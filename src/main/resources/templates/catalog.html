Green peppers are less sweet and slightly more bitter than yellow or orange peppers. Red bell peppers are the sweetest.</p>

It is in the Daisy family (Asteraceae) along with Roman Chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile) and the two plants have similar apple-scented flowers, but they are in separate genera. German Chamomile is taller than Roman Chamomile, growing to heights of 60cm, and produces larger flowers that are 3-5cm in diameter. It has hairless stems and is more compact than it's Roman counterpart. It's essential oil is dark blue, whereas Roman Chamomile's essential oil is pale yellow to clear. German Chamomile is the most popular source of herbal chamomile and is used to calm and nourish the nervous system and support good digestion. Chamomile attracts beneficial insects like hoverflies (which eat aphids and mites) and ladybugs. Chamomile tea can be sprayed on seedlings to prevent damping-off, a fungal infection that can kill young plants.</p>

They are one of the fines herbes of French cuisine and commonly used fresh. The plant forms dense clusters of slender 2-3cm bulbs, which can be cooked. Chive flowers are edible, star-shaped, and pale purple. Chives are a good companion plant because their sulfur compounds repel negative insects, and their flowers attract bees.</p>

The choice between which subspecies to grow depends on latitude and at what point in the growing season you will be planting the crop: garlic can be day-length sensitive. Hard-neck garlic is usually grown in cooler climates and creates larger cloves. Soft-neck garlic is grown in warmer climates and produces smaller, tightly-packed cloves. Be sure to trim garlic scapes before they flower - this will focus the plant's energy into bulb growth, resulting in larger cloves and bulbs. Scapes have a fresh, light garlic flavor. They are delicious raw or cooked, and make a great pesto.</p>

Roots are ground or shredded to make pungent, spicy sauces and condiments. Seeds or root cuttings are planted in the fall, and the taproot is harvested the following year. It can be harvested in fall after the first frost kills off the greens, or in the early spring before new leaves grow. A winter of hard frosts will sweeten the root. Horseradish should be divided and replanted every 2 years to prevent it from becoming woody. The plant spreads rapidly. If invasive tendencies are managed properly, it is a good companion plant because it wards off diseases and repels insects like potato bugs and beetles, aphids, whiteflies, blister beetles, and some caterpillars.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The leek is a vegetable, a cultivar of Allium ampeloprasum, the broadleaf wild leek. The edible part of the plant is a bundle of leaf sheaths that is sometimes erroneously called a stem or stalk. Historically, many scientific names were used for leeks, but they are now all treated as cultivars of A. ampeloprasum. The name 'leek' developed from the Anglo-Saxon word "leac". Two closely related vegetables, elephant garlic and kurrat, are also cultivars of A. ampeloprasum, although different in their uses as food. The onion and garlic are also related, being other species of the genus Allium. Leeks have thick blue-green foliage. The bundle of white leaf sheaths has a mild onion taste and can be blanched, steamed, braised, or grilled and used in soups, stews, omelet fillings, and more. The leaves can be used to make stock. Plant their leeks in autumn, and they should fatten up in time for winter picking. Plant them early to ensure they have enough time to grow before winter. Leeks take up to six months to mature after transplanting. Newer cultivars have quicker maturity ‚Äì three to four months. Maturity is often affected by temperature, available nutrients and water. Leeks need a soil that is rich in organic matter. Dig in compost or manure two weeks before planting. Add fertiliser every few weeks Leeks like aged manure, especially chicken manure, and worm castings, another excellent source of nutrients. Plant seedlings in full sun, with moist but well-drained deep soil. Raised beds are ideal. Water young plants frequently. The white part of the leek is edible; the green is not. You can blanch the stems to increase the proportion of stem that‚Äôs edible and to sweeten the taste. Do this to fully grown leeks. Tie a paper collar around each stem and gently hill the earth up around the stem. Be careful not to get soil between the paper collar and stem as the leek may rot. As the plants grow, add another collar above the first one and hill up more soil. Be aware that slugs and snails can hide in the paper collars Harvest the leeks when stems are around 2.5cm in diameter. Dig carefully around the leek and lift with a garden fork. Do not pull, as the leek is likely to break.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">Strawberry</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Strawberries are a hybrid species of the genus Fragaria that produce sweet, bright red fruits. There are three main types of strawberries: 1) summer-fruiting: produce a single, large crop of fruit the year after planting. To grow, transplant plugs or crowns in early spring in rows spaced at least 120cm apart. Pinch off all flowers the first season and train the plant's runners, pressing them into the soil 15-22cm apart from the mother plant. Mulch with straw or pine needles in the fall when the plants have died back. When the plants start to grow back in the spring, move the mulch aside. After harvest the second season, set a lawnmower to about 10cm high and mow, being sure not to damage crowns. The other two types are 2) Ever-bearing and 3) Day Neutral, both of which send out less runners and bear several crops of smaller fruit throughout the season. These two types can be grown using raised beds about 20cm high and 60cm wide. Transplant crowns or plugs in staggered double rows, about 30cm apart. Remove runners and flowers until July of the first year to give the roots time to develop, and then allow plants to produce fruit. All types of strawberries begin to produce fewer and less sweet fruit once they are two years or older. Because strawberries are a hybrid, seeds will not breed true. Strawberries are predominantly propagated using bare root plugs or crowns or dividing runners. Make sure not to bury the crown when transplanting plugs.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Cherry tomatoes range in size from a thumbtip to the size of a golf ball. Their shape ranges from spherical to slightly oblong to pointed at the bottom. They are often red, but can also be yellow, green, striped, and even black. More oblong cherry tomatoes often share characteristics with plum tomatoes, and are known as grape tomatoes. Cherry tomatoes can be quite sweet (such as the Sungold or Sunsweet yellow varieties), more traditionally acidic, or deep in flavor. They are delicious for snacking, in salads, lightly roasted or grilled, or baked. They require little to no pruning unlike larger tomato plants.</p>
